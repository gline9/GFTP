GCorev0.1.5

  --  Simple FTP server and client for easy file transfer between computers.
  
  --  To use just instantiate the classes and then execute start/ connect for
      servers and clients repectively.
      
  --  Provides FileIO classes if you want to implement your own ftp instead of
      using the built in one, in this case you can use the bit counter class
      in gcore to keep track of how many bits have been sent at any given point 
      in time.
